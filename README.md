![udemy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0303a0ef-6397-4dc4-9e1e-426d44d4e748)

## Inspiration

I wanted to solve the problem of fetching Udemy prices without having to visit their website. That's when I created this service.

## Challenges

Identifying the specific elements to target when scraping Udemy's website.

## Lessons Learned

I learned the fundamentals of web scraping using Pyppeteer and how to use Twilio's text messaging service.

## The Service

This Python program uses the Pyppeteer package to scrape prices from Udemy's website and sends a message using Twilio to a phone number containing the prices and course descriptions.
