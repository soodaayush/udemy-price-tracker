![udemy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0303a0ef-6397-4dc4-9e1e-426d44d4e748)

## Inspiration

I wanted to solve a problem about fetching Udemy prices without going to their website itself. That is when I made this service.

## Challenges

Finding what specific elements to target when scraping Udemy's website.

## Lessons Learned

I learned the fundamentals of web scraping using Pyppeteer. I learned how to use Twilio's text messasing service.

## The Service

This Python program uses the Pyppeteer package to scrape prices off of Udemy's website, and sends a message using Twilio to a phone number containing the prices and their course descriptions.
